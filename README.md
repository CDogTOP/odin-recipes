# odin-recipes

Hello friends! This is CDog and also my first TOP project of the curriculum! Today, I will be coding up a recipe website that will demonstrate all I have learned about HTML up until now. I will be using a variety of HTML tags (links, lists, paragraphs, etc), so I hope you take a look and enjoy yourself while on this repo! I will also do my best to commit early and often and explain in good detail why I change things the way I do. Thanks for stopping by and I hope you all like my project!
