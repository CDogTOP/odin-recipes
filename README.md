# odin-recipes

Hello friends! This is CDog and also my first TOP project of the curriculum! Today, I will be coding up a recipe website that will demonstrate all I have learned about HTML up until now. I will be using a variety of HTML tags (links, lists, paragraphs, etc), so I hope you take a look and enjoy yourself while on this repo! I will also do my best to commit early and often and explain in good detail why I change things the way I do. Thanks for stopping by and I hope you all like my project!


--- DISCLAIMER ---

I do not own any of the recipes mentioned in this project. The recipes on this project are also just for demonstrative purposes, please do not try to use them at home! Also TOP is mentioned a great deal throughout this project as well, however their opinions of the recipes are all written by me. I have written text within those tags to illustrate my knowledge of HTML, nothing more. I will leave links to the recipes I partially used in this project here as I work through and code each file. Thanks for reading and I hope you like the website!
